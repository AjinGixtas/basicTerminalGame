An abandoned game project for learning UI design, sandboxing and system design.

It was really fun :)
Maybe I will revisit it (i won't)

So how do you play?

You don't. You read the code and trying to figure out what's going on. Or type `help`. Either works.



Anyway, I'm off making other, much smaller game. Learn coding by coding a game about coding was deeply pogger to my programming knowledge. Cya :)
